## Overview 🌟

The `Labs` subfolder within `4-advanced_Cont` includes scripts that showcase advanced Python techniques and features. The focus is on demonstrating and experimenting with class structures, inheritance, operator overloading, and file handling.

Within the `Labs` subfolder, there are several specialized folders:

- `csv`: Contains scripts for handling CSV files.
- `EXCEL_Python_Tasks`: Contains scripts for working with Excel files using Python.
- `threading`: contains Python scripts that demonstrate the use of the `threading` module to manage and execute concurrent tasks. These scripts explore creating, starting, and managing threads, as well as printing information related to threads and processes.


### 1. **Class.py** 📜

This script demonstrates several advanced Python concepts related to class definitions, private members, and property decorators.

#### Description 📝

- 😊 **Encapsulation**: The script shows how to use private variables and methods in Python. It demonstrates name mangling to access private members and methods.
- 😊 **Property Decorators**: The script illustrates the use of `@property`, `@<property_name>.setter`, and `@<property_name>.deleter` decorators to manage private variables.

#### Example Code 💻

```python
class test:
    __m = 10

    def printm(self):
        print(self.__m)

    def __pvfun(self):
        print("hello")

t = test() 
t.printm() # Print 10
#print(t.__m) #ERROR
print(t._test__m) #WORKS # Print 10
t._test__pvfun() #WORKS # Print hello

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__private_variable = 10  # Private member

    def get_private_variable(self):
        return self.__private_variable

    def set_private_variable(self, value):
        self.__private_variable = value

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.get_private_variable())  # Accessing private member
obj.set_private_variable(20)  # Modifying private member
print(obj.get_private_variable())  # Accessing modified private member

class Student:
    name = "unknown"

    def __init__(self):
        self.age = 20
        self._my_variable = 10

    @staticmethod
    def tostring():
        print('student class')
    @property
    def my_variable(self):
        return self._my_variable

    @my_variable.setter
    def my_variable(self, value):
        self._my_variable = value

    @my_variable.deleter
    def my_variable(self):
        del self._my_variable

print(Student.tostring()) # Print None if it does not return anything 
obj = Student()

# Accessing the property like an attribute
print(obj.my_variable)

# Setting the property
obj.my_variable = 20

# Deleting the property
del obj.my_variable
```

#### Usage 🔧

class Point:

    def __init__(self, xCoord=0, yCoord=0):
        self.xCoord = xCoord
        self.yCoord = yCoord

    # Overload + operator
    def __add__(self, point_ov):
        return Point(self.xCoord + point_ov.xCoord, self.yCoord + point_ov.yCoord)
    
point1 = Point(2, 4)
point2 = Point(12, 8)
point3 = point1 + point2
print(point3.xCoord)

### 1. **Task_1.py** (in the `Task_1` folder) 🔗

This script is designed to generate an initialization function for GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) configuration in AVR microcontrollers. The script writes to a C file, `init.c`, which includes a function to set the direction of the PORTA pins based on user input. The user is prompted to specify the mode (input or output) for each of the 8 bits of the PORTA register.

#### Key Features 🌟

- Prompts the user to input the mode for each bit (input or output).
- Generates a C function that configures the PORTA register based on the user’s input.
- Writes the generated function to the `init.c` file in the format suitable for AVR microcontroller initialization.

#### Usage 🔧

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Input the mode for each bit when prompted.
3. The script will generate the `init.c` file with the appropriate initialization function.

#### Example Output 🖼️

```C
void init_PORTA_DIR (void)
{
    DDRA = 0b00001111;
