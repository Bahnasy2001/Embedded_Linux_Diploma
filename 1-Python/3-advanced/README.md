webbrowser.get("C:/Program Files/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/Application/brave.exe %s").open(link)
dirpath = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
pointxy = None
while pointxy is None:
    pointxy = pyautogui.locateOnScreen(r""+dirpath+"\Advanced_Linux_Command_Line.png",confidence=0.1)

if pointxy is not None:
    pyautogui.moveTo(pointxy[0]+800,pointxy[1]+720,duration=0.8)
    print(pyautogui.position())
